### Idea for test resolution

```
1. I started by creating the emailsList function which allows to create an array of one million lists   that contain email addresses.

2. I created the sendEmail function wich allows to simulate the sending of emails by going throw the list
of emails then with the predefined function setIntervale which will allow us to control the repetitive execution time of a function which is 500 milliseconds and to display on the console a message of confirmation of the emails sending
```
